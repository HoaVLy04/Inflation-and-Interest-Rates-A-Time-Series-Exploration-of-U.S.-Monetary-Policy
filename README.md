# Inflation-and-Interest-Rates-A-Time-Series-Exploration-of-U.S.-Monetary-Policy
This project explores the dynamic relationship between U.S. inflation rates and the Federal Reserveâ€™s interest rate decisions over time. Specifically, we aim to investigate how changes in the Federal Funds Rate impact inflation, and whether there is a lagged effect in this relationship.
